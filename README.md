## Overview

Heinrich is an open-source AI engine that combines classical TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving) methodology with modern Large Language Models to provide systematic, interpretable inventive problem-solving capabilities. Named after Genrich Altshuller, the creator of TRIZ, Heinrich embodies the systematic thinking approach of the original methodology while leveraging contemporary AI advances.

### Key Features

- **Systematic TRIZ Pipeline**: 7-module workflow following classical TRIZ methodology
- **Interpretable Reasoning**: Every step is logged and traceable to TRIZ principles
- **Knowledge Base**: Complete 39 parameters, 40 principles, contradiction matrix
- **Multi-modal Support**: Text problems, technical specifications, patent analysis
- **Evaluation Suite**: Curated case base with reference solutions
- **Multilingual**: Full documentation in English, Chinese, and Russian
- **Ethical AI**: Transparent persona with safety guidelines

## Quick Start

```bash
# Installation (coming soon)
pip install heinrich-triz

# Solve a problem
heinrich solve --input problem.txt --report solution.md

# Interactive mode
heinrich interactive --mode hybrid

# Batch processing
heinrich batch --input-dir problems/ --output-dir solutions/
```

### Example Problem

**Input**: "We need to make a car faster, but increasing engine power makes it consume more fuel."

**Heinrich Output**:
```
Step 1: Problem Analysis
- Technical system: Automotive propulsion
- Desired improvement: Speed (Parameter 9)
- Harmful consequence: Energy consumption (Parameter 19)

Step 2: Contradiction Identification
- Physical contradiction: Engine must be powerful AND energy-efficient
- Technical contradiction: Speed vs Energy consumption

Step 3: Principle Selection
- Principle 15: Dynamics (variable characteristics)
- Principle 2: Taking out (separate conflicting properties)
- Principle 35: Parameter change (different states/properties)

Step 4: Solution Concepts
1. Variable compression ratio engine (Principle 15)
2. Hybrid powertrain with mode switching (Principle 2)
3. Active aerodynamics adaptation (Principle 35)
...
```

## Architecture

Heinrich implements a modular, interpretable TRIZ reasoning pipeline:

```
Problem Input
     ‚Üì
[Problem Parser] ‚Üí Normalized problem description
     ‚Üì
[Contradiction Identifier] ‚Üí Technical/Physical contradictions
     ‚Üì
[Principle Selector] ‚Üí Relevant TRIZ principles (1-40)
     ‚Üì
[Effects Lookup] ‚Üí Scientific effects and evolution patterns
     ‚Üì
[Concept Generator] ‚Üí Solution concepts with reasoning
     ‚Üì
[Adaptation Planner] ‚Üí Context-aware recommendations
     ‚Üì
[Report Builder] ‚Üí Structured solution report
```

## Core Modules

- **Problem Parser**: Extracts essence from unstructured problem descriptions
- **Contradiction Identifier**: Maps to 39 TRIZ parameters and identifies contradictions
- **Principle Selector**: Selects relevant principles from contradiction matrix
- **Effects Lookup**: References scientific effects and evolution patterns
- **Concept Generator**: Creates solution concepts with TRIZ traceability
- **Adaptation Planner**: Contextualizes solutions for real-world constraints
- **Report Builder**: Generates structured, traceable solution reports

## The Heinrich Persona

Heinrich operates as an AI mentor inspired by Genrich Altshuller's methodical thinking style. This persona:

- Follows systematic TRIZ methodology rigorously
- Provides educational explanations for each step
- Maintains ethical boundaries and transparency
- **Important**: This is an AI system inspired by TRIZ principles, not a simulation of the real person

## Knowledge Base

Heinrich includes comprehensive TRIZ knowledge:

- **39 Technical Parameters**: Complete parameter definitions and relationships
- **40 Inventive Principles**: Detailed principles with sub-principles and examples
- **Contradiction Matrix**: 39√ó39 matrix mapping contradictions to principles
- **Scientific Effects Database**: Physics, chemistry, and biological effects
- **Evolution Patterns**: 8 patterns of technical system evolution
- **Case Base**: Curated educational cases with reference solutions

## Evaluation and Quality

Heinrich includes rigorous evaluation capabilities:

- **Case-based Testing**: Validated against classical TRIZ educational cases
- **Consistency Metrics**: Measures contradiction identification accuracy
- **Completeness Metrics**: Evaluates principle coverage and reasoning depth
- **Expert Review**: Structured templates for TRIZ expert evaluation
- **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmarks against other AI problem-solving approaches

## Multilingual Support

Full documentation and interface support for:

- **English**: Primary development language
- **‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese)**: Complete translation with technical terminology
- **–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π (Russian)**: Complete translation honoring TRIZ origins
