- id: 7
  name: Nesting
  description: Place one object inside another
  sub_principles:
    - Place one object inside another; place each object, in turn, inside the other
    - Make one part pass through a cavity in the other
  examples:
    - Russian dolls
    - Telescoping structures
    - Nested containers
    
- id: 8
  name: Anti-weight
  description: Compensate for the weight of an object
  sub_principles:
    - To compensate for the weight of an object, merge it with other objects that provide lift
    - To compensate for the weight of an object, make it interact with the environment
  examples:
    - Hot air balloons
    - Hydrofoils
    - Magnetic levitation
    
- id: 9
  name: Preliminary anti-action
  description: Perform the opposite action in advance
  sub_principles:
    - If it will be necessary to do an action with both harmful and useful effects, this action should be replaced with anti-actions to control harmful effects
    - Create beforehand stresses in an object that will oppose known undesirable working stresses later on
  examples:
    - Prestressed concrete
    - Vaccine immunization
    - Pre-loading mechanisms
    
- id: 10
  name: Preliminary action
  description: Perform the required change in advance
  sub_principles:
    - Perform, before it is needed, the required change of an object (either fully or partially)
    - Pre-arrange objects such that they can come into action from the most convenient place
  examples:
    - Pre-cut materials
    - Ready-to-assemble furniture
    - Pre-positioned tools
    
- id: 15
  name: Dynamics
  description: Allow or design the object to be adaptive
  sub_principles:
    - Allow (or design) the object to adapt automatically to optimal operating conditions
    - Divide an object into parts capable of movement relative to each other
    - If an object (or process) is rigid or inflexible, make it movable or adaptive
  examples:
    - Variable compression engines
    - Adjustable suspensions
    - Adaptive optics
