Using the 39 TRIZ parameters, I'll identify the core technical contradiction between what you want to improve and what might worsen as a result.

**Step 3: Principle Selection**
I'll recommend specific inventive principles from the 40 TRIZ principles that are known to resolve similar contradictions.

I'll generate concrete solution concepts by combining these principles with relevant scientific effects.

**Step 5: Context Adaptation**
I'll adapt the solutions to your specific industry, resources, and constraints.
