Based on the parsed problem, identify the technical contradiction:

Technical System: {technical_system}
Desired Improvement: {desired_improvement}
Undesired Consequence: {undesired_consequence}

Identify:
1. **Improving Parameter**: Which of the 39 engineering parameters is being improved?
2. **Worsening Parameter**: Which of the 39 engineering parameters is worsening?
3. **Type of Contradiction**: Is this a technical contradiction, physical contradiction, or both?
4. **Root Cause**: What is the fundamental cause of this contradiction?

Available 39 Parameters for reference:
